# 🧠 Natural Language to Churn Prediction API

This project is a RESTful API that allows users to input **natural language queries** and receive **churn predictions** powered by a machine learning model. It uses an **open-source LLM** to interpret free-form text, a **Pydantic parser** to structure the input, and a custom-trained churn prediction model to return results.

## 🚀 Features

- 🎯 Accepts natural language input for churn prediction via REST API  
- 🤖 Converts queries to structured features using **LLM + Pydantic**  
- 🧠 Uses a trained ML model to estimate **customer churn probability**  
- 🔌 Fast and lightweight API built with **FastAPI** (or Flask if you used it)  
- 📦 Modular structure for easy extension and deployment
